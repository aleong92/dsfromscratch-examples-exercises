# Data Science From Scratch

## About this project
The idea behind this repository is to go over every topic in [**Joel Grus's**][authorref] magnificent book: [**_Data Science From Scratch_**][bookref] and include variations, with different levels of complexity, of the examples and exercises.

## Why do this?
Learning to code using a programming book has a fatal, yet avoidable trap: **becoming an automaton**.  

Copying the code written by the author and pasting it into a terminal got me nowhere in terms of understanding. **I needed to iterate over the examples and exercises.**

I consider myself a **"_learning by doing_"** kind of person. Hence, to sleep calmly at night, confident that my intellectual honesty has not suffered a fatal blow, I tried to write my version of the code used in Joel's book.

## What will you find here?
There will be a Jupyter Notebook for every chapter in Joel's book.  

Each one will feature the code snippets for every example covered in the chapter. **I'll try to be as clear and concise as possible.**
